# üåê ESP32 Modular IoT Framework 

A fully modular embedded system project built on ESP32-S3 using ESP-IDF 5.4. The system integrates UART, Wi-Fi, HTTPS cloud communication, ADC-based light sensor (you can add whatever sensor you want), and **BLE GATT-based communication**. Future support for MQTT is also planned.

##  Features

-  Auto-reconnecting Wi-Fi connection manager
-  Periodic light sensor reading via ADC (because currently I only have light sensor T_T)
-  Secure HTTPS POST to cloud with JSON data
-  Data reporter module with 5-second upload loop
-  UART echo for sensor debugging
-  BLE GATT Server: Notify mobile device with sensor data (e.g., light value)**
-  Modular source structure for scalability
-  **Over-the-air (OTA) firmware update based on wifi** (30s after boot, you can change when you want to ota)
-  Future-ready for MQTT integration

##  Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- ESP-IDF 5.4+ installed and configured (Vscode ESP-IDF extension available)
- Supported board: ESP32-S3 devkit
- Internet access for cloud upload
- BLE mobile app (e.g., **nRF Connect** by Nordic)

### 2. Build and Flash

```bash
idf.py set-target esp32s3
idf.py build
idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 flash monitor
```

### 3. Wi-Fi Configuration

Update your SSID and password in `data_reporter.c`:

```c
#define WIFI_SSID "your-ssid"
#define WIFI_PASS "your-password"
```

### 4. BLE Verification

- Install **nRF Connect** mobile app (or other)
- Scan and connect to `ESP_GATTS_DEMO`
- Locate the characteristic under service UUID `0x00FF`
- Enable **Notify**
- You will receive 4-byte little-endian integer (e.g., light = `0x0802 = 520`)

### 4. OTA Update Test

Workflow:
Firmware boots and connects to Wi-Fi

ota_test_task starts counting to 30

After 30s, it performs OTA via HTTPS:

```c
https://<your_server_ip>:8443/firmware.bin 
```

To test OTA, build a new firmware version, host it on your server, and let the device auto-update.

For complete OTA server setup instructions, refer to:

```c
/server/README_SERVER.md
```

---

##  JSON Upload Format

Data is uploaded every 5 seconds with structure like:

```json
{
  "esp32": "2025-04-11 14:23:52",
  "uart_data": "light: 472",
  "hello": 23
}
```

You can modify `json_utils.c` to use field-style format instead:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-04-11T14:23:52",
  "light": 472,
  "count": 23
}
```
